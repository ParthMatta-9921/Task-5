also from 151 to 315 for when i went to github.com on the browser.


ICMPv6: no port as a 3rd layer protocol
after getting address from DNS server for the site microsoft.com, the source sends a packet with icmpv6 as protocol
for a ping to the site.
from 105 to 114.

used for trasnporting the packets in a secured manner. used for important and tme insensitive packets.
packets get arranged when reaches dest if not in sequence by this protocol.
